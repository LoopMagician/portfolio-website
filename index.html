        <li><a href="https://loopmagician.itch.io/the-legend-of-zelda-unity-rendition">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></li>
        <p>
            This is my project partner's and I's rendition of The Legend of Zelda. The game was made 
            with Unity 6.
        </p>
        <p>
            During development, I took part in early game mechanics, such as the camera and player
            movement, the Old Man Room, the 2D bow room, collectibles, doors, pushable objects, 
            room set up, and the HUD. During the later stages of development, I came up with and 
            implemented the flying Umbrella Mechanic as well as the Custom Level and everything
            that had to do with it. 

            I thouroughly enjoyed developing the project and I am proud of the work that I did on it.
            Both my parter and I spent many hours working on it, and I can say that I feel good about 
            the final product. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it.

        <li><a herf="https://loopmagician.itch.io/asteroid-defense">Asteroid Defense</a></li>
        <p>
            This is another project that I created in Unity 6. It is the first game that I have created
            on my own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a full description of the games development process:
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a two week sprint. During the sprint, I created tasks for myself to implement into the 
            game. In particular, I had to create the environment which included the city game object. I also
            had to create the asteroid prefeb and its movement script which also controlled destroying the
            object on user click. This script was linked to another script that would spawn the asteroids at 
            random intervals and increase the difficulty by increasing the speed and spawn rate. After This
            was complete, I was faced with a design decision for the flow of gameplay. The city had to have
            a health status, but an object of that type wouldn't suit well with something as simple as a health
            bar. Instead, I added a crumbling effect that lowered the city off the screen during each hit.
            After the last hit, the city will continue to crumble until it is completely off the screen, in 
            which the game will end. I also created a score, start menu, and game over menu ui to accompany
            the game. Once this was done, the core of my game had been developed. At this point it was time
            to add the 'juice' to the game. This included things such as explosion effects, sound effects,
            background music, and a crosshair for the player. This is the jist of what the game currently is.
            I hope you enjoy it.
