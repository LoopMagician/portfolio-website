        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly, if you are reading this, I would like to thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
            I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
            I found a passion in the world of coding my sophomore year of college after taking an introductory course
            in C++ programming, and from there I began a journey of discovering all the nooks and crannies coding has to offer.
            During my tenure at the University of Michigan, I have taken a variety of courses on different topics, including 
            cybersecurity, machine learning, web development, and game development. I have also had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects
            in these fields. I have a passion for learning and I am always looking for new challenges to take on. 
            I am currently looking for a full-time position in the field of software development, but I am open to any opportunities that come my way. 
            If you would like to learn more about me, please feel free to reach out to me through my socials at the top of the page.

            <div class="project" style="padding: 15px">
                <p><b>Penetration Tester - Converge Technology solutions (May 2024 - August 2024)</b></p>
                <p>
                    Penetration testing is a job that requires a lot of attention to detail. There
                    is no step-by-step guide on how to approach a new client's web application and it is up to 
                    the tester to find the vulnerabilities and exploit them. This is the job in which I was 
                    tasked with during my time at the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The learning experience that I had this summer was extensive. Penetration testing requires
                    that the tester has a good understanding of the web application and the different components
                    used within the application. From there, testing required testing different kinds of attacks
                    tailored to the application. The types of attacks in which I learned during my experience included
                    SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks and many more niche types of attacks like race conditions and 
                    upload vulnerabilities. I was fortunate to be able to use my skills against real clients and 
                    deliver them the vulnerabilities in which I found during testing, telling them how they can be
                    reproduced and what needed to be done to fix them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a great experience not only in the fact that I garned extensive technical experience,
                    but it also allowed me to gain experience with client interaction. I believe it is just as important
                    to know how to deliver the vulnerabilities to the client as it is to be able to find them. My experience
                    also introduced me to tools like BurpSuite and Kali Linux, which included tools like Nmap, Metasploit, SQLMap
                    and much more, so I was able to gain some experience with that as well.
                </p>

            <h3><b>Educational Experience</b></h3>
            <div class="project" style="padding: 15px">
                <p><b><a href="https://eecs388.org/">EECS 388</a> F24 at The University of Michigan</b></p>
                <p>
                    I took this course after my experience with Converge Technology soutions. The course gave
                    way to a more in-depth understanding of web security practices that I already had experience with; this 
                    included a review of SQL injection, CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, authentication vulnerabilities, cryptography
                    and more. However, this class also introduced me to new topics and concepts that strengthened
                    my understanding of cybersecurity as a whole. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    EECS 388 was advertised as a "throw a lot of different information at you and see what sticks" kind of
                    course, which ended up being completely true. Along with reinforcing my knowledge of web attacks that I
                    had a bit of experience with, they also introduced a variety of different attacks and defenses in which we
                    were able to have a lot of practice with. This included length extension attacks, learning how to find hash
                    collisions and what it means for a hashing algorithm to have one, shellcode ROP exploitation, and more.
                    Along with all of these different concepts that we learned, we were also taught how to use certain cybersecurity
                    tools like Ghira, Autopsy, wireshark and command line tools like John the Ripper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course did a great job of introducing as many different concepts as possible in the time that we had.
                    Cybersecurity is an extremely vast field. It is that kind of thing where the more you learn, the more you realize
                    how much more there is to know. Everything kind of came together with all of the different concepts that were 
                    introduced in the course with the final project, which was one of the most extensive but rewarding projects that
                    I have ever done. The project was basically a CTF, but more of an investigation of a fake scenario. It required
                    us to use every tool and skill that we have learned in the class to solve the case. To name a few, we had to use
                    Autopsy to investigate a hard drive, use wireshark to investigate network traffic, use Ghira to investigate a
                    website, and about every other skill to find more information about the person involved with the case. It was a
                    great learning experience and really emulated what a real cyber investigation would feel like.

                    This is a web development course in which I am currently enrolled in at the University of Michigan. So far, we 
                    have created static web pages, used Jinja templates to create server-side dynamic pages, and React and JavaScript
                    to create client-side dynamic pages. We have also learned how to use a SQLite to store and fetch information.
                    Later, we will be creating a search engine.

                    This is my project partner's and I's rendition of The Legend of Zelda. The game was made 
                    with Unity 6.

                <p>
                    During development, I took part in early game mechanics, such as the camera and player
                    movement, the Old Man Room, the 2D bow room, collectibles, doors, pushable objects, 
                    room set up, and the HUD. During the later stages of development, I came up with and 
                    implemented the flying Umbrella Mechanic as well as the Custom Level and everything
                    that had to do with it. 

                    I thouroughly enjoyed developing the project and I am proud of the work that I did on it.
                    Both my parter and I spent many hours working on it, and I can say that I feel good about 
                    the final product. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it.

                <p>
                    This is another project that I created in Unity 6. It is the first game that I have created
                    on my own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a full description of the games development process:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a two week sprint. During the sprint, I created tasks for myself to implement into the 
                    game. In particular, I had to create the environment which included the city game object. I also
                    had to create the asteroid prefeb and its movement script which also controlled destroying the
                    object on user click. This script was linked to another script that would spawn the asteroids at 
                    random intervals and increase the difficulty by increasing the speed and spawn rate. After This
                    was complete, I was faced with a design decision for the flow of gameplay. The city had to have
                    a health status, but an object of that type wouldn't suit well with something as simple as a health
                    bar. Instead, I added a crumbling effect that lowered the city off the screen during each hit.
                    After the last hit, the city will continue to crumble until it is completely off the screen, in 
                    which the game will end. I also created a score, start menu, and game over menu ui to accompany
                    the game. Once this was done, the core of my game had been developed. At this point it was time
                    to add the 'juice' to the game. This included things such as explosion effects, sound effects,
                    background music, and a crosshair for the player. This is the jist of what the game currently is.
                    I hope you enjoy it.
